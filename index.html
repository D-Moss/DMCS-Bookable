								Death Valley & Rhyolite Ghost Town — DMCS Notes
							</h2>
							<p class="modal-paragraph">
								I joined this tour with hotel pickup from Las Vegas, which made the early start much easier. The views at Zabriskie Point were the highlight — absolutely stunning and perfect for photos. It was a long day with a lot of driving, and depending on the season, the heat can be intense. I’d definitely do it again, especially for anyone who loves dramatic desert landscapes or photography. My tip: bring extra water, sunscreen, and a portable charger — this trip drains both your energy and your phone battery quickly.

							<h2 id="nyc-cruise-title" class="modal-title">NYC Landmarks Cruise — DMCS Notes</h2>
							<p class="modal-paragraph">
								I got to the cruise terminal by walking from Times Square, which was an easy and scenic route along the west side of Manhattan. The views from the boat were the highlight — especially seeing the Statue of Liberty up close and passing under the Brooklyn Bridge. The ride was smooth, the narration was clear, and it’s great for quick sightseeing without committing to a long tour. The only downside is that it can get crowded during peak times, so early boarding helps. I’d definitely do it again, especially for first-time NYC visitors. My DMCS tip: try to sit on the outdoor deck for the best photos and hold your phone tight — the wind gets serious out there!

								I got to the ranch using the included pickup from Las Vegas, which made the morning start much easier. The horseback ride itself was peaceful and relaxing with beautiful early-morning desert views, and the guides did a great job matching riders with horses based on experience. Breakfast was simple but enjoyable — classic ranch-style food served outdoors. The only downside is waking up early, but the sunrise lighting and cooler temperatures make it worth it. I’d definitely do it again, especially for anyone who wants a calm, nature-focused break from the Strip. My DMCS tip: wear comfortable jeans or leggings and bring a small jacket — the desert mornings can be chilly.

								I used the included pickup service from Las Vegas, which made this quick tour even easier. The ride was comfortable, the guide shared interesting facts along the way, and the photo stops overlooking Lake Mead and the Hoover Dam gave some amazing views. It’s a short tour, so it never feels rushed, but it also doesn’t require a full day. The only thing I didn’t love was the crowding around some viewpoints, especially during peak times. Overall, I’d absolutely do this tour again — it’s perfect if you want something scenic and educational without committing to a long day trip. My DMCS tip: bring sunglasses and a hat — the sun reflects strongly off the concrete and the water, even in cooler months.

								I used the included pickup from Las Vegas, which made arriving at the ranch simple and stress-free. The sunset lighting made the entire ride feel peaceful and cinematic — easily one of the most beautiful times to be out in the desert. The guides were patient and friendly, and the horses were calm, making the ride comfortable even for beginners. Dinner afterward felt like a true Western experience, with warm food and a relaxing campfire atmosphere. The only thing I didn’t love was that it gets chilly quickly once the sun goes down, so layering helps. I’d definitely do this again, especially for couples or anyone wanting a slower, scenic experience outside of the Strip. My DMCS tip: bring a light jacket and keep your phone charged — the golden-hour photos are worth it.
